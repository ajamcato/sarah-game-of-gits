House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned, despite what a famed tv show scripted out for him, was able to watch his children grow olders and find happiness and peace with their little wolf companions while he grew old with his wife. Everyone lived happily ever after.
